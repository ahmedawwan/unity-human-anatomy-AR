This is a views-folder which means all views and themes (XUML-files) with the extension .xml in this folder (and subfolders) will be automatically processed by the MarkLight view processor.

To create a new custom view right-click on the folder and select Assets->Create->View.

You can add/change folders processed by the view processor by modifying the configuration asset at /MarkLight/Configuration/Configuration.asset
